				<h1>Comedy Movies</h1>	
				<p>
					A comedy film is a genre of film which mainly focuses on humor. <br>
					These films are designed to make the audience laugh through entertainment and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.<br><br>
					Comedy, compared with other film genres, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity.<br>
					While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary
				</p>
	
				<h3>History of comedy</h3>
				<p>Cinematic comedy can be considered as one of the most prolific, popular and the oldest film genre. <br><br>
					Comedy was ideal for the early silent films, as it was dependent on visual action and physical humor rather than sound.
					The first comedy film was L'Arroseur Arrosé (1895), directed and produced by Louis Lumière. <br><br>
					The most noted comedy actors of the era were Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton.</p>

				<h4>Comedy of manners</h4>

				Also, satirical comedy-drama & the plot is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. 
				
				
				
				<h4>Screwball comedy</h4>
				<p>It was not uncommon for the early romantic comedy film to also be a screwball comedy. This genre was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. 
					There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films.
