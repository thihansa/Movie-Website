  <br><br><br><br><font size="4">Adventure Films are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. 
  Adventure films are very similar to the action film genre, in that they are designed 
  to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the film viewer. Rather than the 
  predominant emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in action films, however, the viewer 
  of adventure films can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, 
  struggles and situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists.</font></p>

  <font size="4"> Adventure films were intended to appeal mainly to men, creating major male heroic stars through the 
  years. These courageous, patriotic, or altruistic heroes often fought for their beliefs, &nbsp &nbsp struggled for freedom, or overcame 
  injustice. Modern adventure films, some of which have been successful blockbusters, have crossed over and added resourceful 
  action heroes (and &nbsp &nbsp oftentimes heroines).
  Under the category of adventure films, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles 
  (similar to the epics film genre), searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and 
  quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often set in an historical period, 
  and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes (Robin Hood, Tarzan, and Zorro for example), kings, battles, 
  rebellion, or piracy.
  Adventure films share many elements with other genres - there are numerous examples of sci-fi, fantasy, 
  and war films with characteristics of this genre. Adventure films, in a broader context, could include boxing movies, motor racing
  films, and films adapted from literary novels (i.e., King Solomon's Mines (1937 and 1950), The Thief of Bagdad (1924 and 1940), The 
  Three Musketeers (1916, 1921, 1933, 1935, 1948, 1973, and 1993), and The Prisoner of Zenda (1937, 1952)).</font></p>
